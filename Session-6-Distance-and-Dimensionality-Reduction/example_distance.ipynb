many to turn down extra shifts for fear of high tax bills.\",\"Within our first 30 days, we will hold an urgent review, working with the British Medical Association and Academy of Medical Royal Colleges to solve the problem.\",\"It is a basic, compassionate Conservative belief that we should care for those in need \\u2013 helping those who cannot help themselves.\",\"Thanks to decades of economic growth and scientific innovation, people are living longer, healthier lives.\",\"But this, alongside the rise of dementia and other chronic conditions, means that the pressures on the elderly

investment is made.\",\"In the 21st century, we need to get away from the idea that \\u2018Whitehall knows best\\u2019 and that all growth must inevitably start in London.\",\"Because we as Conservatives believe you can and must trust people and communities to make the decisions that are right for them.\",\"To underpin this national renewal, we will invest \\u00a3100 billion in additional infrastructure spending \\u2013 on roads, rail\",\"and other responsible, productive investment which will repair and refurbish the fabric of our country and generate greater growth in the long run.\",\"For example, flood defences will receive \\u00a34 billion in new funding.\",\"We will ensure that we are always spending what we can afford \\u2013 with strict limits on borrowing and repayment costs.\",\"We will use this historic investment to level up and connect this country, so that everyone can get a fair share of its future prosperity.\",\"Our new Towns Fund will help communities make sure their towns are safe to walk in and a pleasure to be in.\",\"We want there to be things to do, great places to shop and eat and transport to be easy.\",\"Above all, we want the town\\u2019s future to be in the hands of the people who live there.\",\"The Towns Fund will go to an initial 100 towns to improve their local economy \\u2013 and they and only they will make the choice about what improvements their local area needs.\",\"We will cut taxes for small retail businesses and for local music venues, pubs and cinemas.\",\"As well as our investment in schools and technical education, we will invest \\u00a3500 million in new youth clubs and services.\",\"A new Safer Streets Fund will invest in preventative measures like new CCTV or community wardens.\",\"We have announced the largest cultural capital programme in a century, of \\u00a3250 million.\",\"This will support local libraries and regional museums.\",\"We will work with local universities to do more for the education, health and prosperity of their local areas.\",\"We will establish a \\u00a3150 million Community Ownership Fund to encourage local takeovers of civic organisations or community assets that are under threat \\u2013 local football clubs, but also pubs or post offices.\",\"We will set up a fan-led review of football governance, which will include consideration of the Owners and Directors Test,\",\"and will work with fans and clubs towards introducing safe standing.\",\"And we will help communities that want to create \\u2018pocket parks\\u2019 and regenerate derelict areas.\",\"Through the Cultural Investment Fund, outlined above, we will also support activities, traditions and events that bring communities together.\",\"We will support local and regional newspapers, as vital pillars of communities and local democracy,\",\"including by extending their business rates relief.\",\"A key part of our plan to level up the UK\\u2019s cities and regions is to connect them.\",\"Leeds is the largest city in Western Europe without a light rail or metro system.\",\"And European cities are often more productive than our own in large part because they have better infrastructure.\",\"We will build Northern Powerhouse Rail between Leeds and Manchester and then focus on Liverpool, Tees Valley, Hull, Sheffield and Newcastle.\",\"We will invest in the Midlands Rail Hub, strengthening rail links including those between Birmingham, Leicester, Nottingham, Coventry, Derby, Hereford and Worcester.\",\"We will also invest in improving train lines to the South West and East Anglia.\",\"We will extend contactless pay-as-you go ticketing to almost 200 more stations in the South East, meaning that 50 per cent of all rail journeys and almost all London commuter journeys can be completed using a contactless bank card.\",\"We will give city regions the funding to upgrade their bus, tram and train services to make them as good as London\\u2019s,\",\"with more frequent, better-integrated services,\",\"and smart ticketing \\u2013 such as the vision proposed by Andy Street for the West Midlands.\",\"The railways need accountability, not nationalisation.\",\"So we will end the complicated franchising model and create a simpler, more effective rail system,\",\"including giving metro mayors control over services in their areas.\",\"We will make a \\u00a328.8 billion investment in strategic and local roads.\",\"We will invest \\u00a31 billion in completing a fast-charging network to ensure that everyone is within 30 miles of a rapid electric vehicle charging station.\",\"We will consult on the earliest date we can phase out the sale of new conventional petrol and diesel cars,\",\"while minimising the impact on drivers\",\"We will require that a minimum service operates during transport strikes.\",\"Rail workers deserve a fair deal, but it is not fair to let the trade unions undermine the livelihoods of others.\",\"HS2 is a great ambition, but will now cost at least \\u00a381 billion and will not reach Leeds or Manchester until as late as 2040.\",\"We will consider the findings of the Oakervee review into costs and timings and work with leaders of the Midlands and the North to decide the optimal outcome.\",\"To help communities across the country, we will restore many of the Beeching lines, reconnecting smaller towns such as Fleetwood and Willenhall that have suffered permanent disadvantage since they were removed from the rail network in the 1960s.\",\"We will invest in superbus networks\",\"bring back and protect rural routes,\",\"We will invest in electric buses, developing the UK\\u2019s first all-electric-bus town.\",\"We will launch the biggest ever pothole-filling programme as part of our National Infrastructure Strategy\",\"\\u2013 and our major investment in roads will ensure new potholes are much less likely to appear in the future.\",\"We will support commuter cycling routes, so that more people can cycle safely to work\",\"and more families can go out together.\",\"We will create a new \\u00a3350 million Cycling Infrastructure Fund with mandatory design standards for new routes.\",\"We will extend Bikeability \\u2013 cycling proficiency training \\u2013 to every child.\",\"And we will work with the NHS to promote cycling for healthier living.\",\"Parliament has voted in principle to support a third runway at Heathrow, but it is a private sector project.\",\"It is for Heathrow to demonstrate that it can meet its air quality and noise obligations,\",\"that the project can be financed and built and that the business case is realistic.\",\"The scheme will receive no new public money.\",\"More broadly, we will use new air traffic control technology to cut the time aircraft spend waiting to land, reducing delays, noise nuisance and pollution.\",\"We will also build on Britain\\u2019s pioneering work in electric and low-carbon flight.\",\"We are Europe\\u2019s technology capital, producing start-ups and success stories at a dazzling pace.\",\"But not everyone can share the benefits.\",\"We intend to bring full fibre and gigabit-capable broadband to every home and business across the UK by 2025.\",\"We know how difficult it will be, so we have announced a raft of legislative changes to accelerate progress and \\u00a35 billion of new public funding to connect premises which are not commercially viable.\",\"Local government is the bedrock of our democracy.\",\"We are proud that Conservative councils have led the way in helping keep council taxes low, providing value for money and supporting local communities.\",\"We will ensure that councils continue to deliver essential local services \\u2013 which is why they received a substantial funding increase in the most recent Spending Round.\",\"Local people will continue to have the final say on council tax, being able to veto excessive rises.\",\"This does not prevent councils raising more \\u2013 but it does ensure that they will need to have solid and convincing reasons for doing so.\",\"We remain committed to devolving power to people and places across the UK.\",\"Our ambition is for full devolution across England, building on the successful devolution of powers to city region mayors, Police and Crime Commissioners and others, so that every part of our country has the power to shape its own destiny.\",\"We will publish an English Devolution White Paper setting out our plans next year.\",\"Through our City and Growth Deals we have already delivered more than \\u00a39 billion of funding across England,\",\"and almost \\u00a33 billion to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\",\"Through bodies like the Northern Powerhouse, Western Gateway and Midlands Engine we will drive greater levels of foreign investment into the UK, promoting our towns, cities and counties around the world.\",\"As part of our plans for full devolution we will also invite proposals from local areas for similar growth bodies across the rest of England, such as the Oxford-Cambridge Arc.\",\"This is an agenda which shows that the days of Whitehall knows best are over.\",\"We will give towns, cities and communities of all sizes across the UK real power and real investment to drive the growth of the future and unleash their full potential.\",\"The biggest problem that young people face in getting on the housing ladder is the deposit.\",\"There are more than three million people, many of them with good jobs and secure prospects, who would have been homeowners before the economic crisis in 2008 but have been locked out of the mortgage market.\",\"We will encourage a new market in long-term fixed rate mortgages which slash the cost of deposits, opening up a secure path to home ownership for first-time buyers in all parts of the United Kingdom.\",\"We will offer more homes to local families, enabling councils to use developers\\u2019 contributions via the planning process to discount homes in perpetuity by a third for local people who cannot otherwise afford to buy in their area.\",\"Councils could use this to prioritise key workers in their area, like police, nurses and teachers.\",\"We will maintain our commitment to a Right to Buy for all council tenants.\",\"We will also maintain the voluntary Right to Buy scheme agreed with housing associations.\",\"Following the successful voluntary pilot scheme in the Midlands, we will evaluate new pilot areas in order to spread the dream of home ownership to even more people.\",\"And we have extended the Help to Buy scheme from 2021 to 2023 and will review new ways to support home ownership following its completion.\",\"We will reform shared ownership, making it fairer and more transparent.\",\"We will simplify shared ownership products by setting a single standard for all housing associations, thereby ending the confusion and disparity between different schemes.\",\"We will continue with our reforms to leasehold including implementing our ban on the sale of new leasehold homes,\",\"restricting ground rents to a peppercorn,\",\"and providing necessary mechanisms of redress for tenants.\",\"We will bring in a Better Deal for Renters, including abolishing \\u2018no fault\\u2019 evictions\",\"and only requiring one \\u2018lifetime\\u2019 deposit which moves with the tenant.\",\"This will create a fairer rental market:\",\"if you\\u2019re a tenant, you will be protected from revenge evictions and rogue landlords,\",\"and if you\\u2019re one of the many good landlords, we will strengthen your rights of possession.\",\"Home ownership is one of the most fundamental Conservative values.\",\"People are happier, more secure and more rooted in their communities when they own their own home \\u2013 and know that they can pass it on to future generations.\",\"For the UK to unleash its potential, young people need the security of knowing that home ownership is within their reach \\u2013 that they too can have a tangible stake in society,\",\"can be rooted in their communities\",\"and have a place to raise a family.\",\"A majority Conservative Government will continue to increase the number of homes being built.\",\"But we must also rebalance the housing market towards more home ownership \\u2013\",\"while ensuring fairness for the new generation of renters.\",\"While we want to encourage as many people as possible into home ownership,\",\"we recognise that not everyone can afford their own home \\u2013 and that those in social housing deserve the same dignity, respect and fair treatment as private renters.\",\"As Boris Johnson has promised, we will bring forward a Social Housing White Paper which will set out further measures to empower tenants and support the continued supply of social homes.\",\"This will include measures to provide greater redress,\",\"and improve the quality of social housing.\",\"We will also commit to renewing the Affordable Homes Programme, in order to support the delivery of hundreds of thousands of affordable homes.\",\"This is a key part of our efforts to prevent people from falling into homelessness,\",\"along with fully enforcing the Homelessness Reduction Act.\",\"We will also end the blight of rough sleeping by the end of the next Parliament by expanding successful pilots and programmes such as the Rough Sleeping Initiative and Housing First,\",\"and working to bring together local services to meet the health and housing needs of people sleeping on the streets.\",\"We will help pay for this by bringing in a stamp duty surcharge on non-UK resident buyers.\",\"Since 2010 there has been a considerable increase in homebuilding.\",\"We have delivered a million homes in the last five years in England:\",\"last year, we delivered the highest number of homes for almost 30 years.\",\"That is why we will continue our progress towards our target of 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s.\",\"This will see us build at least a million more homes, of all tenures, over the next Parliament \\u2013 in the areas that really need them.\",\"And we will make the planning system simpler for the public and small builders,\",\"and support modern methods of construction.\",\"Crucially, however, we need to make sure homes are built in a way that makes sense for the people already living in the area and for the families moving in:\",\"We will amend planning rules so that the infrastructure \\u2013 roads, schools, GP surgeries \\u2013 comes before people move into new homes.\",\"And our new \\u00a310 billion Single Housing Infrastructure Fund will help deliver it faster.\",\"We will ask every community to decide on its own design standards for new development, allowing residents a greater say on the style and design of development in their area,\",\"with local councils encouraged to build more beautiful architecture.\",\"Following the Grenfell tragedy there has rightly been a focus on building safety.\",\"No report or review can truly capture the heartache, sorrow, anger and grief that many people feel.\",\"We have already committed to implementing and legislating for all the recommendations of the Hackitt Review and the first phase of the independent inquiry.\",\"We will continue to work with industry, housing associations and individuals to ensure every home is safe and secure.\",\"And we will support high rise residential residents with the removal of unsafe cladding,\",\"and continue with our rigorous process of materials testing.\",\"We will support community housing by helping people who want to build their own homes find plots of land and access the Help to Buy scheme.\",\"We will also support communities living on council estates who want to take ownership of the land and buildings they live in.\",\"We will support the creation of new kinds of homes that have low energy bills\",\"and which support our environmental targets\",\"and will expect all new streets to be lined with trees.\",\"We will encourage innovative design and technology to make housing more affordable, accessible, and suitable for disabled people\",\"We will protect and enhance the Green Belt.\",\"We will improve poor quality land,\",\"and make our beautiful countryside more accessible for local community use.\",\"In order to safeguard our green spaces, we will continue to prioritise brownfield development, particularly for the regeneration of our cities and towns.\",\"We want Britain to be the best country in the world to start and grow a business\",\"\\u2013 a place where entrepreneurs know they can build on their ideas and find success.\",\"Not only because businesses are good for society \\u2013 creating the jobs that put bread on the table\",\", and generating the tax revenue that funds our vital public services.\",\"But because we believe that we should do everything we can to support those who want to start their own company, strike out on their own, and have an idea that grows into a world-leading business.\",\"Our mission as Conservatives is to give everyone across the country the opportunity to fulfil their potential.\",\"We are a highly competitive economy\",\"and well-respected regulatory framework.\",\"We have more world-class universities than anywhere in Europe.\",\"We are a magnet for talent, and home to more innovative and successful new companies than anywhere on the continent\",\"\\u2013 especially in the technology sector.\",\"In areas such as tech, financial services, law and the creative industries we lead the world \\u2013\",\"and will continue to do so after Brexit.\",\"Of the nearly six million businesses in this country, the vast majority are small and medium sized.\",\"Small and family businesses are the backbone of the economy and Britain is immeasurably stronger for their contribution.\",\"Once we get Brexit done, we can use our new freedoms to ensure that Britain\\u2019s businesses can unleash their enormous potential \\u2013 that they can invest, hire, export and grow,\",\"rather than being crushed by Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell\\u2019s inexorable hostility towards aspiration and entrepreneurship.\",\"We understand the challenge of increasing running costs, especially for smaller firms, and are committed to reducing them.\",\"Our plan to upgrade infrastructure will make it easier for businesses to operate \\u2013 to move goods about the country\",\"and to connect to customers around the world via gigabit broadband.\",\"And our new \\u00a33 billion National Skills Fund, alongside other major investment in skills and training\",\"and our reforms to high-skilled immigration,\",\"will ensure that businesses can find and hire the workers they need.\",\"But we also want to tackle the other everyday obstacles that they face.\",\"We will cut the burden of tax on business by reducing business rates.\",\"This will be done via a fundamental review of the system.\",\"As a first step, we will further reduce business rates for retail businesses,\",\"as well as extending the discount to grassroots music venues,\",\"That means protecting your high street and community from excessive tax hikes\",\"and keeping town centres vibrant.\",\"We will increase the Employment Allowance for small businesses \\u2013 a tax cut for half a million small firms.\",\"We will support start-ups and small businesses via government procurement, and commit to paying them on time.\",\"We will also clamp down on late payment more broadly\",\"and strengthen the powers of the Small Business Commissioner to support small businesses that are exploited by their larger partners.\",\"We will expand start-up loans, which have particularly high take-up from women and BAME entrepreneurs.\",\"The British Business Bank has supported 90,000 smaller businesses with over \\u00a37 billion in investment or loans, and will continue to grow.\",\"We will help SMEs to become exporters, so that they can seize the opportunities that will become available once we get Brexit done.\",\"Good regulation is essential to successful businesses:\",\"we will strive to achieve the right regulatory balance between supporting excellent business practice\",\"Through our Red Tape Challenge, we will ensure that regulation is sensible and proportionate,\",\"and that we always consider the needs of small businesses when devising new rules,\",\"using our new freedom after Brexit to ensure that British rules work for British companies.\",\"As well as encouraging investment in physical building and equipment,\",\"\\uf02fwe will help employers invest in skills\",\"and look at how we can improve the working of the Apprenticeship Levy.\",\"Every day, people risk their savings and their future by becoming entrepreneurs.\",\"They invent the new goods and services that improve our lives.\",\"From decarbonisation to expanding the frontiers of artificial intelligence, they are tackling some of the great challenges of our time.\",\"We want to be a nation of start-ups, and of successful scale-ups.\",\"We have more \\u2018unicorns\\u2019 \\u2013 new billion-dollar tech companies \\u2013 than any other nation in Europe.\",\"We are proud of the work we have done to support entrepreneurship and want to see more entrepreneurs,\",\"including women and those from BAME backgrounds.\",\"Some of our work has been spectacularly successful \\u2013 such as the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme and Enterprise Investment Scheme, which we will continue in the next Parliament.\",\"And by cutting corporation tax from 28 per cent to 19 per cent, we have encouraged more businesses to invest and grow in the UK.\",\"Some measures have worked, but need to go further \\u2013 as with R&D tax credits.\",\"We will increase the tax credit rate to 13 per cent\",\"and review the definition of R&D so that important investments in cloud computing and data, which boost productivity and innovation, are also incentivised.\",\"We also have to recognise that some measures haven\\u2019t fully delivered on their objectives.\",\"So we will review and reform Entrepreneur\\u2019s Relief.\",\"Of course, supporting enterprise is not just about championing businesses \\u2013 more people than ever are moving into self-employment, especially women.\",\"We will therefore launch a review to explore how we can better support the self-employed.\",\"That includes improving their access to finance and credit (not least mortgages),\",\"making the tax system easier to navigate,\",\"and examining how better broadband can boost home-working.\",\"Conservatives believe in a corporate tax system which rewards entrepreneurship\",\"We will always be whole-heartedly on the side of business,\",\"while making sure everyone pays their fair share of tax.\",\"Already, the top 1 per cent of income taxpayers pay over 29 per cent of income tax\\u2013 higher than at any time under the last Labour Government.\",\"We will continue to build on this to tackle tax evasion\",\"and reduce opportunities for aggressive tax avoidance.\",\"Since 2010, we have introduced more than 100 anti-avoidance measures\",\"and secured more than \\u00a3200 billion which would otherwise have gone unpaid \\u2013 \\u00a324 billion in the last year alone.\",\"We have led the international fight against aggressive tax avoidance and offshore tax havens, rewriting global rules to ensure tax is paid where profit is made.\",\"This has included committing 100 jurisdictions to ending bank secrecy.\",\"The gap between the amount of tax that should be paid and is actually collected stands at \\u00a335 billion \\u2013 still too high.\",\"Hard-working families and businesses who do pay their fair share should know that we will not permit evasion to go unchecked.\",\"So we will set out a new anti-tax avoidance and evasion law.\",\"This will: Double the maximum prison term to 14 years for individuals convicted of the most egregious examples of tax fraud.\",\"Create a single, beefed-up Anti-Tax Evasion unit in HMRC that covers all duties and taxes, from individual errors to deliberate non-compliance \\u2013 which is put on a legislative footing.\",\"Consolidate existing anti-evasion and avoidance measures and powers.\",\"Introduce a new package of anti-evasion measures, including measures to end tax abuse in the construction sector,\",\"crack down on illicit tobacco packaging\",\"and further measures to avoid profit-shifting by multinational companies to avoid paying taxes.\",\"Major multinational companies should pay their fair share of tax.\",\"As part of our approach, we will implement the Digital Services Tax.\",\"While always backing entrepreneurs that choose to make the UK the place to invest and set up a business,\",\"we will take further action to redesign the tax system so that it boosts growth,\",\"and limits arbitrary tax advantages for the wealthiest in society.\",\"We are also strengthening the UK\\u2019s corporate governance regime, and will reform insolvency rules and the audit regime so that customers and suppliers \\u2013 and UK taxpayers \\u2013 are better protected when firms like Thomas Cook go into administration.\",\"We will also carefully study the results of the ongoing investigation into its collapse.\",\"We will improve incentives to attack the problem of excessive executive pay and rewards for failure.\",\"We will reintroduce legislation that protects pension pots from being plundered by reckless bosses,\",\"helps savers be better informed with pension dashboards,\",\"and creates a new style of pension scheme which is more sustainable for workers and employers.\",\"The 2020s will see a transformation in jobs.\",\"Automation and computing will change how businesses function.\",\"Our plan to deliver clean energy and a carbon-neutral future means new kinds of jobs in new industries.\",\"And our departure from the European Union means we can develop forward-looking regulations to ensure we are first in line to develop and benefit from the technologies of the future.\",\"This requires a dramatic rebooting of our training system\",\"existing businesses and the businesses of the future.\",\"But above all, we want to ensure that Britain\\u2019s workers have the skills they need to flourish\",\"\\u2013 and that every citizen of this country has the opportunity to express their talents to the fullest.\",\"Since 2010, the Government has invested significantly in technical qualifications and apprenticeships, with 3.8 million more apprenticeships.\",\"In the next Parliament, we expect to train up hundreds of thousands more highly skilled apprentices.\",\"But we will go further and require significant numbers of new UK apprentices for all big new infrastructure projects \\u2013 new hospitals, new schools, major transport projects and so on,\",\"being built with pride by a new generation of British workers.\",\"Whatever age you are, nothing is more Conservative than working hard to improve your lot\",\"and nothing is more important for the Conservative Party than supporting people in those efforts.\",\"Our reforms and investment in education and skills mean more children are leaving school better equipped for working life\",\"and there are more high quality apprenticeships.\",\"But there is much more to do to level up the skills of the entire nation.\",\"Not just to improve Britain\\u2019s productivity,\",\"but to enable people to fulfil their potential.\",\"As the centrepiece of our plan, we will create a new National Skills Fund worth \\u00a33 billion over the next Parliament.\",\"This fund will provide matching funding for individuals and SMEs for high-quality education and training.\",\"A proportion will be reserved for further strategic investment in skills, and we will consult widely on the overall design.\",\"The National Skills Fund will help to transform the lives of people who have not got onto the work ladder and lack qualifications,\",\"as well as people who are keen to return to work from, say, raising a family, or switch from one career to another.\",\"It will not only make this country more prosperous, but fairer.\",\"Just as universities have been transformed by significant long-term investment over the last few decades, we need to make sure local colleges are equally excellent places for people to learn.\",\"We are therefore investing almost \\u00a32 billion to upgrade the entire further education college estate.\",\"And we\\u2019ll also have 20 Institutes of Technology, which connect high-quality teaching in science, technology, engineering and maths to business and industry.\",\"Vitally, leaving the EU also means that we can take back control of the money that was being channelled via its Structural Funds.\",\"We have already announced a UK Shared Prosperity Fund, to ensure that the people of the UK do not lose out from the withdrawal of EU funding\",\"(which was, of course, only a small part of the billions of pounds we were contributing),\",\"and to replace the EU programme with one that is fairer and better tailored to our economy.\",\"And we will ensure that \\u00a3500 million of the UK Shared Prosperity Fund is used to give disadvantaged people the skills they need to make a success of life.\",\"Taken together, this package of measures represents a profound commitment to Britain\\u2019s future \\uf02f\\u2013\",\"to helping people of whatever age and background navigate the new world of work,\",\"equip themselves with the skills they need,\",\"The UK is home to leading universities, which attract students from all over the world, conduct vital research, and generate enormous benefits for our economy and our society.\",\"They also do an excellent job of generating many of the skills that our economy needs, producing globally renowned scientists, entrepreneurs and creators, and enabling millions of people to fulfil their potential.\",\"In the next Parliament we will work to maintain and strengthen our global position in higher education.\",\"The Augar Review made thoughtful recommendations on tuition fee levels, the balance of funding between universities, further education and apprenticeships and adult learning, and we will consider them carefully.\",\"We will look at the interest rates on loan repayments with a view to reducing the burden of debt on students.\",\"We also will continue to explore ways to tackle the problem of grade inflation and low quality courses,\",\"and improve the application and offer system for undergraduate students.\",\"Our approach will be underpinned by a commitment to fairness, quality of learning and teaching, and access.\",\"We will also strengthen academic freedom and free speech in universities\",\"and continue to focus on raising standards.\",\"We will strengthen universities and colleges\\u2019 civic role.\",\"We will invest in local adult education and require the Office for Students to look at universities\\u2019 success in increasing access across all ages, not just young people entering full-time undergraduate degrees.\",\"As well as making Britain the best place to start a business,\",\"and the best place to learn and develop your skills,\",\"we want to make the UK the best place in the world to work.\",\"The increase in employment that the Conservative Government has overseen since 2010 is proof that there is no contradiction between high employment and high standards\",\"\\u2013 between dynamic growth and protecting employees from unfair policies

allowance,\",\"and introduced and consistently raised the National Living Wage to ensure that people get to keep more of what they earn\",\"And we have aimed to strike the right balance between the flexibility that the economy needs and the security that employees deserve,\",\"introducing new protections for workers\",\"while preserving the dynamism and job creation that drive our shared prosperity.\",\"Once we have got Brexit done, we will go further.\",\"Because people cannot fulfil their potential if they do not have jobs that treat them with dignity and respect,\",\"and if they

already taken forward a number of recommendations from the Taylor Review and will build on existing employment law with measures that protect those in low-paid work and the gig economy.\",\"For example: We will create a single enforcement body and crack down on any employer abusing employment law, whether by taking workers\\u2019 tips or refusing them sick pay.\",\"We will ensure that workers have the right to request a more predictable contract and other reasonable protections.\",\"We also want to look at more radical ways to support working families in the UK.\",\"Our lifestyles have been transformed over the last four decades \\u2013 many families today have two working parents who are juggling work and other responsibilities.\",\"They have to stretch themselves daily to care for children, elderly relatives and those with disabilities.\",\"For women, who still tend to be the main carers in households, this can have a big impact on their careers and limit their participation in the workplace.\",\"But while the modern workplace is adapting as a result, we can do more as a Government to make things easier, learning from sensible approaches adopted in other countries.\",\"We will therefore introduce a raft of measures that balance the needs of employees and employers:\",\"We will encourage flexible working and consult on making it the default unless employers have good reasons not to.\",\"We have reformed redundancy law so companies cannot discriminate against women immediately after returning from maternity leave.\",\"We will legislate to allow parents to take extended leave for neonatal care, to support those new mothers and fathers who need it during the most vulnerable and stressful days of their lives.\",\"And we will look at ways to make it easier for fathers to take paternity leave.\",\"We will extend the entitlement to leave for unpaid carers, the majority of whom are women, to a week.\",\"Over the last nine years, we have extended the offer of free childcare hours to more working parents.\",\"We know that people value this support, but wish it could be more flexible.\",\"As outlined above, we will fund more high-quality childcare before and after school and during the holidays\",\"so that working parents do not have to choose between their careers and their children.\",\"Our vision for the labour market,

otherwise be out of reach,\",\"and liberate people from job insecurity.\",\"We think financial security is a key building block of a good society.\",\"No one currently in receipt of benefits will be worse off under UBI - and many will be much better off.\",\"Those excluded or overlooked by the current means-tested system will see the biggest benefits.\",\"This includes low to medium income families with children, young people and students, and some pensioners.\",\"Someone earning the minimum wage and working 37.5 hours a week would see their income increase by 10 to 15% through UBI.\",\"UBI will also start to challenge how work is often valued as simply about earning money to drive consumption,\",\"as part of our plans to encourage sensible, green economic decision making for the long term.\",\"This universal enrichment will provide all of us with new options and opportunities, in both our work and personal lives.\",\"Our Green New Deal for incomes will: Phase in the introduction of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) sufficient to cover an adult\\u2019s basic needs.\",\"UBI will be an unconditional payment, paid to all UK residents regardless of employment status.\",\"Replace most income-related benefits with UBI (except for the additional benefits described below).\",\"Replacing a large range of variously means-tested benefits with one unconditional payment will simplify and streamline the system.\",\"Ensure nobody will be worse off.\",\"The adult rate of UBI of \\u00a389 per week will result in around a 6% increase in disposable income over five years for someone in full\\u00actime work and paid the average salary.\",\"It is our firm intention to increase in particular adult rates at regular intervals during the first full parliamentary term.\",\"Include additional payments above the basic adult rate for some groups of people:\",\"Pensioners will receive a weekly payment totalling \\u00a3178.\",\"Disabled people will receive an additional supplement to their UBI, as will lone parents and lone pensioners.\",\"People who were reliant on Housing Benefit before UBI was introduced will continue to receive it, so that they can cover their rent.\",\"Families with an income of under \\u00a350,000 per year will receive an additional supplement of \\u00a370 per week for each of their first two children\",\"and a further \\u00a350 per week for each additional child.\",\"Families with an income of over \\u00a350,000 per year will receive smaller additional supplements per child,\",\"with the amount decreasing further the more a family earns.\",\"Draw directly on income from the Carbon Tax to help fund UBI,\",\"thereby ensuring that the proceeds of the tax on carbon emissions help meet the cost of enabling people to make the transition to a carbon free future.\",\"These reforms will integrate closely with the proposals set out in the \\u2018Delivering secure incomes and homes\\u2019 section on page 49.\",\"The

dominance.\",\"We believe this will lead to a renewed focus on the EU\\u2019s potential to deliver effective solutions to poverty,\",\"- and help secure a long-term, positive future for the UK in the EU.\",\"Our plan to transform Europe will: Allow Members of the EU Parliament to initiate Europe-wide legislation, something they don\\u2019t currently have the power to do.\",\"In time, we hope that

charade keeps billions of pounds out of the public purse every year, money that could be spent on new homes, schools and hospitals.\",\"It\\u2019s time to straighten out the tax system, so that tax avoiders can no longer evade their responsibilities,\",\"and so that income from wealth is taxed the same as income from work.\",\"This will ensure that the wealthiest pay their fair share.\",\"Our Green plan to simplify tax will shine a light on the corners of the economy where the richest stash their wealth.\",\"We will: Merge Employees National Insurance, Capital Gains Tax, Inheritance Tax, Dividend Tax and Income Tax into a single Consolidated Income Tax.\",\"This closing of loopholes will bring in an estimated \\u00a320 billion extra per year into the public purse.\",\"It will mean that all income is treated the same way for tax purposes.\",\"Tax income from investments/ assets at the same level as the taxation of income from work, through the Consolidated Income Tax.\",\"This will end the injustice whereby people who work for their incomes are taxed more highly than those whose income is derived from wealth.\",\"Replace the Income Tax threshold with Universal Basic Income.\",\"End the double taxation of pension funds, which are currently subject to Corporation Tax and then Income Tax when paid out to individual pensioners.\",\"The Green Party wants to transform land and property taxes.\",\"Half of England is owned by less than 1% of its population.\",\"Our tax system allows landlords to sit on land and do nothing whilst public money for enhancements sees land value increase.\",\"It is one of the main ways of taxing wealth, yet bands are still based on valuations from 1991.\",\"This means someone in a multi-million pound property pays a far lower proportion of tax than someone in a one-bedroom flat.\",\"All the while, small and independent businesses are crying out for reform of the unfair business rates system,\",\"and young people face a lifetime of housing insecurity and high prices.\",\"Over the long term we will take steps to replace the current unjust, out-of\\u00acdate system with a Land Value Tax (LVT), designed to redistribute wealth\",\"and help fix our broken housing market.\",\"LVT will be a single tax (replacing the multiple taxes that currently exist) which will capture the real value of land, and the increased value arising from improvements to it.\",\"Winston Churchill backed an LVT, arguing that the value added to a property because of improvements, like transport infrastructure, paid for by the public purse, should be returned to the community.\",\"The many other benefits include bringing more brownfield sites into use;\",\"discouraging speculative land banking;\",\"and more efficient, sustainable use of land.\",\"LVT will help stabilise the property market and shift the burden of taxation from land users, including renters and business tenants, to wealthy landowners.\",\"It\\u2019s a critical part of how to tackle the housing crisis.\",\"Our Green plan to transform land and property taxes will: Abolish Council Tax and Business Rates, replacing them with an LVT.\",\"The LVT will also absorb National Non-domestic Rates, Stamp Duty on Land, Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings, Capital Gains Tax on land sales, Inheritance Tax on land and Income Tax on land for owner- occupiers.\",\"The new LVT will charge the landowner a proportion of the capital value of the land each year (estimated to be around 1.4% of current values).\",\"Ensure LVT is paid by landowners regardless of whether or not they live on the land.\",\"This will incentivise those who own empty properties to release them back into the housing market.\",\"Lift millions of renters and business tenants out of property taxes altogether, by shifting the burden of land taxation from land users to landowners.\",\"We will legislate to prevent landowners passing these tax costs back to renters and tenants.\",\"Phase in the changes over ten years, with reliefs on offer.\",\"This will ensure that the vast majority of homeowners will face similar or lower levels of tax to that which they pay now.\",\"Protect those who have low incomes but who are \\u2018land rich\\u2019 with a right to defer the tax until the property is sold or transferred.\",\"Likewise, pensioners who are homeowners will be enabled to \\u2018roll over\\u2019 LVT payments until their property is sold, so they don\\u2019t feel undue pressure to move.\",\"In the long term, the new LVT will bring in more money for the public purse.\",\"However due to the phased introduction of the policy, and the reliefs we will offer to help homeowners transition to the new system, we estimate that the LVT will be revenue neutral for the first ten years (bringing in the same amount of revenue as the taxes it replaces).\",\"In a transformed green economy we will need to harness the power and influence of businesses to do good.\",\"At the moment, huge corporations tend to use their power to generate profit for a small number of people and to reduce the amount of tax they pay.\",\"We think it\\u2019s time to straighten things out, so nobody can abuse the tax system and dodge their responsibilities.\",\"When Corporation Tax was first introduced to the UK in 1965, it stood at 40%. Now it\\u2019s at 19%, one of the lowest in Europe.\",\"And overseas giants like Amazon and Google exploit tax loopholes to pay even less.\",\"Businesses can be the bedrock of an economy that enables us all to thrive, if they pay what they owe and invest in the public services and infrastructure from which they benefit.\",\"Our plan for tax justice Increase the rate of Corporation Tax to 24%, in line with the Organisation for Economic Co\\u00acoperation and Development (OECD) average.\",\"We will advocate public country-by-country reporting and consolidated Corporate Tax across the EU to prevent profit shifting\",\"This will counteract the huge levels of support previous governments have given the banking sector, through public protections, licenses and subsidies.\",\"We will also close a loophole in the Stamp Duty on Shares, by including share purchases of all values and new share issues within the Duty.\",\"Establish HM Revenue & Customs as an independent agency of government, answerable to Parliament.\",\"This will remove the power of politicians to strike secret deals with powerful corporations and individuals.\",\"Entrench the anti-avoidance principle in UK tax law and oblige banks to provide information about companies automatically to HMRC.\",\"Close down Corporation Tax loopholes by widening the definition of \\u2018profit\\u2019 to cover dividends, share buybacks, additions to cash holdings, payments to parent or subsidiary companies (both onshore and offshore), and other distributed income.\",\"Clamp down on tax havens internationally and, domestically,\",\"require offshore companies to reveal their beneficial ownership before being accepted as competitors for publicly funded contracts.\",\"In instances where beneficial ownership is not clear and/or payments are made to secretive tax havens, all money and assets transferred will be treated as income distribution and taxed at the full Corporate or Income Tax level.\",\"We will explore how to best to tackle tax avoidance channelled through British Overseas Territories.\",\"We will campaign for the EU to clamp down on member state tax havens, including Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.\",\"Abolish the rule that allows non\\u00acdomiciled residents not to pay tax on foreign income.\",\"We will transform our economy to make it work for the wellbeing of people and our environment - and we want business to play a leading role.\",\"We want enterprise in the 21st century to be about more than what pays.\",\"We want to support enterprise to create a bigger, more diverse future, through stakeholder finance, ownership rooted in communities and business done for the common good.\",\"We recognise the many challenges facing businesses today, especially small, local businesses, run by families or individuals - and the enormous value they bring to the communities they serve.\",\"We understand how hard it is to start and run a business - and how rewarding it can be when that business grows.\",\"We want to transform the business environment in the UK, so enterprise that benefits us all is rewarded and helped to thrive.\",\"The Green plan for a small business revolution will: Give small businesses access to lending at affordable rates, by helping to establish a network of regional mutual banks.\",\"These new banks will be created specifically to provide funding for locally led economic initiatives and opportunities, including co\\u00acoperatives, community interest companies and other non-profit businesses.\",\"Further free up funding by introducing credit guidance for traditional banks, requiring them to increase their lending to small businesses\",\"and businesses focussed on the sustainability transition.\",\"Grant 15% of government contracts to small and micro businesses.\",\"We will revise the government contract application process, to remove the current barriers for entry to small business.\",\"We will encourage local authorities to adopt this model with their own contracts.\",\"Require businesses to publish and report the difference between agreed payment days and actual payment days.\",\"We will introduce fines for large companies that fail to pay small businesses on time.\",\"Support small business to work with employees to adopt full workplace rights.\",\"Create new support for entrepreneurs and small business owners from BME backgrounds.\",\"Reduce VAT on food and drink served in pubs, bars and restaurants, on hotel bookings and on theatre, music concert and museum and gallery tickets,\",\"This will boost the leisure and cultural sectors,\",\"helping 125,000 businesses at the heart of their local communities.\",\"Increase the Employment Allowance to \\u00a310,000 (currently just \\u00a33,000) per year, allowing small businesses which employ people to claim back the equivalent National Insurance of four full-time workers earning the average salary.\",\"This tax cut will benefit hundreds of thousands of small businesses, allowing them to hire more people, increase wages or reduce prices.\",\"Promote and support an increase in co-operatives and community interest companies.\",\"Education about these forms of communal enterprise would start in school.\",\"Successive governments have committed large sums of public money to projects that contribute nothing to the potential for a safer, fairer future for all.\",\"Beliefs that big is always best, that growth is good for growths sake and that communities and environments can be sacrificed have left a dreadful legacy of public harm and financial waste.\",\"It\\u2019s time to pull the plug on what hasn\\u2019t worked so we can invest instead in the Green New Deal and other ways to sustainably transform the state of the nation.\",\"As we transition to a net zero economy the Green Party will tackle wasteful spending, starting by: Cancelling the Trident nuclear weapons system\",\"and nuclear powered submarines.\",\"We will join the United Nation\\u2019s Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and work within that multilateral framework work for the total elimination of all nuclear weapons, including the implementation, enforcement and verification of all disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation agreements.\",\"We need a security system that can keep us safe from 21st-century challenges, not one that could realise cold war nightmares.\",\"The funds saved from cancelling Trident will be diverted towards the development of non-carbon- emitting technologies\",\"and finance to help countries deal with the Climate Emergency.\",\"Scrapping the government\\u2019s new road building programme, including the proposed road tunnel at Stonehenge that threatens to desecrate an iconic World Heritage Site.\",\"The funding for this road building programme, the \\u00a36.5 billion in revenue received from Vehicle Exercise Duty each year, will be switched to supporting sustainable
